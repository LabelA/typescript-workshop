# TypeScript workshop
To participate the workshop you should have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) installed. Clone the project and run `npm install` to install the packages.

For each exercise we wrote a test you have to run in the terminal. This test will do type checking. For example for exercise you should run `npm run test-1`.
You have completed the exercise if the terminal doesn't return errors anymore. **Exercise 08 doesn't has a test.**

*note: with some exercies you can get 0 errors on multiple ways, we show and teach you what we consider best practice.*

Every test has an `index-X.ts`, `solution-X.ts` and `test-X.ts`. Only open the the `index.ts` file if you want to learn it the good way ðŸ˜‰! You can always ask for help if you can't figure it out yourself.
